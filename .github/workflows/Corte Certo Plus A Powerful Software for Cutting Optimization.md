Corte Certo Plus is the most advanced edition of Corte Certo, a software that has been in the market for over 20 years and has more than 20,000 users worldwide. It offers many features that make it stand out from other cutting optimization software, such as:
 
- Labels with barcode: You can print labels with barcodes for each part or sheet, making it easier to identify and track them.
- Data export: You can export data from Corte Certo Plus to other software, such as ERP systems or machines that perform the cutting. This allows you to integrate your workflow and avoid errors.
- Centralization of sheets registration: You can register your sheets on your server and use them with more than one Corte Certo installation. This ensures consistency and avoids duplication.
- Option to respect the direction of the fibers or grooves of the material: You can specify if your material has a preferred direction for cutting, such as wood grains or metal grooves. Corte Certo Plus will respect this direction and optimize the cutting accordingly.
- Projects can have different materials: You can mix different types of materials in the same project, such as wood and glass. Corte Certo Plus will calculate the best cutting plan for each material separately.
- Extra parts: You can add extra parts to fill in free spaces in the cutting plan. These are parts that are commonly used or have high demand, such as drawer fronts or sides.
- Inventory control of plates, scraps and extra parts: You can keep track of your inventory of sheets, scraps and extra parts. Corte Certo Plus will alert you when you need to buy more material or when you have excess material.
- Manual post-editing: You can manually edit the cutting plan generated by Corte Certo Plus, using sophisticated tools that allow you to move, rotate, resize, split or merge parts. You can also add comments or annotations to the plan.
